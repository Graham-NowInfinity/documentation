Release notes 09 April 2019:

1. **Knowledge Base added to main menu* 
Knowledge Base has been added to the main menu. Knowledge Base is a central electronic repository of articles and videos. 
This resource in an information hub which provides up-to-date answers about information on Corporate Messenger, Trust Register and helpful Administration information.

2. **Create non-ASIC Shareholders** 
Users can now manually add non-ASIC shareholders to companies via the allotments table.
This feature is actioned by creating a new shareholder or when lost allotments are imported into the share registry. 
These options are now available for:
-	Public Companies for all users with “FULL” access permissions AND
-	Non-public companies to users with a role of SUPERUSER.

3. **New Payment Instruction**
Due to specifics of ASIC protocols sometimes an invoice may not be delivered to NowInfinity’s software.  NowInfinity has developed a new automatic Payment Instruction that extracts and compares previous and current debt for active companies on the platform.
The new Payment Instruction enables NowInfinity to report the difference for outstanding payments. This new option will calculate the debt difference owing to ASIC and administers an invoice that will reflect the new debt to the company. Members will be provided with a Payment Instruction notice to indicate that an “increase in debt” has been identified. The instruction will be sent to the company’s account manager.

The new NowInfinity Chat Widget provides the ability for members to either chat or send email messages to the NowInfinity support team. The NowInfinity Chat Widget automatically pre-fills your name into the chat window. You will also be provided with the top ‘help’ suggestions to direct you to common platform questions, or specific inquiries can be typed into the help menu.
